# GREP Command

## Example 1: `-i`

Here, we use the grep command with `-i` to look for escondido in the Vallarta-History text in the Berlitz 2 directory within travel guides. Adding `-i` searches through the text case insensitively. Adding `-i` insures that you can find all of the chosen word in the text, regardless of its capitalization and will be an accurate representation of how many is in the text.

Puerto Escondido and Huatulco
Even though Puerto Escondido is the more mature tourist destination of the two, Huatulco has the deepest historical roots. The Aztecs and Chichimecs (a Nahuatl-speaking warrior community) knew Huatulco as an important trading port long before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors.
Puerto Escondido was established in 1928 as a port for shipping coffee. Its importance diminished as coffee shipments began to be transported by truck. In the 1960s tourists discovered the town after it was connected to other coastal towns by Highway 200. With its renowned offshore break, Puerto Escondido became the ultimate destination for backpackers, flower children, surfers looking for the perfect wave, and those attracted by natural beauty and the laid-back pace. True escapists preferred to continue south and visit Puerto Angel, a fishing village that was Oaxacaâ€™s busiest port for a brief period in the 1870s, before reverting back to its peaceable ways.
